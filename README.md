CARDEKHO Used Car Price Prediction
The main objective of this project is to build a ML model to accurately predict the used car prices by analyzing the features like model,fuel type, age of car, kms_driven, mileage, engine displacement etc.

Data Preprocessing: Extensive cleaning and feature engineering on car data, including encoding categorical variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to further understand the data and some insights were derived. Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBRegressor were evaluated, with ExtraTreesRegressor chosen for deployment due to its superior performance. Streamlit App: A user-friendly interface where users can input car details to get instant price predictions. Integrated with a ExtraTreesRegressor model for high accuracy.

Python Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
